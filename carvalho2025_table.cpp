 * Program: carvalho2025_table.cpp
 *
 * Detailed Description:
 * This program is designed to compute and tabulate normalized wave height parameters
 * for shallow-water environments, utilizing the Composite Weibull distribution model.
 * All wave heights are normalized by the root-mean-square wave height (Hrms) to provide
 * dimensionless ratios, which are fundamental for understanding wave statistics in complex
 * shallow foreshore conditions where wave breaking significantly alters traditional
 * wave height distributions (e.g., Rayleigh distribution).
 *
 * The core functionality of this program involves a robust numerical solution using
 * the Newton-Raphson method for a system of two non-linear equations:
 *
 * 1.  **Iterating through Normalized Transitional Wave Height (Htr/Hrms)**:
 * The program systematically varies the normalized transitional wave height (Htr_Hrms)
 * from 0.01 to 3.50 in increments of 0.01. The transitional wave height (Htr) is a
 * critical parameter in the Composite Weibull distribution, marking the point where
 * the wave height distribution transitions from a Rayleigh-like behavior (for smaller waves)
 * to a different, more complex behavior influenced by wave breaking (for larger waves).
 *
 * 2.  **Solving for Normalized Scale Parameters (H1/Hrms and H2/Hrms) Simultaneously**:
 * For each Htr_Hrms value, the program solves a system of two non-linear equations
 * to determine H1_Hrms and H2_Hrms simultaneously. This is a significant improvement
 * over sequential solving, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the relationship
 * between the two Weibull components.
 * The two equations are:
 * a) The normalized Hrms equation, which states that the overall normalized Hrms of the Composite Weibull distribution
 * must precisely equal one.
 * b) The continuity condition, which ensures
 * a smooth transition between the two Weibull components at Htr.
 * The Newton-Raphson method for systems of equations is employed, which involves
 * calculating the Jacobian matrix (matrix of partial derivatives) at each iteration.
 *
 * 3.  **Computing Normalized Quantile Wave Heights (H(1/N)/Hrms)**:
 * Once H1_Hrms and H2_Hrms are successfully determined, the program computes the
 * corresponding normalized quantile wave heights for a predefined set of exceedance
 * probabilities (represented by N values, e.g., N=3 for H1/3, N=10 for H1/10, etc.).
 * These calculations utilize specific formulas,
 * depending on the relationship between Htr_Hrms and the specific quantile being calculated.
 * These quantiles represent the mean of the highest 1/N-part of the wave heights,
 * providing crucial insights into the statistical properties of extreme waves.
 *
 * Output:
 * The program generates a formatted text file named "carvalho2025_table.txt". This file
 * contains a comprehensive table of Htr_Hrms, H1_Hrms, H2_Hrms, and the various
 * H(1/N)/Hrms values, providing a valuable reference for wave height analysis in
 * shallow-water coastal engineering applications.
 *
 * All gamma functions applied, either complete or incomplete, are non-normalized.
 *
 * Compilation Instructions:
 * To compile this program with high optimization levels, you can use a g++ command similar to this:
 *
 * g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic \
 * -Wconversion -Wsign-conversion -static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ \
 * -o carvalho2025_table.exe carvalho2025_table.cpp
